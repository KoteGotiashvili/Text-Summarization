# WikiSum-BART

This project fine-tunes the BART-large-CNN model on the D0rj/WikiSum dataset to perform automatic text summarization. By training on Wikipedia articles, the model generates accurate and concise summaries, which are evaluated using ROUGE metrics. 

## Features:
- Fine-tuning of the BART-large-CNN model
- Training on the D0rj/WikiSum dataset of Wikipedia articles
- Evaluation using ROUGE metrics

This repository demonstrates the application of advanced NLP techniques for text summarization tasks.
